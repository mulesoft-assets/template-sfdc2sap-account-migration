# License Agreement
This template is subject to the conditions of the <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/templates-examples/AnypointTemplateLicense.pdf">MuleSoft License Agreement</a>. Review the terms of the license before downloading and using this template. You can use this template for free with the Mule Enterprise Edition, CloudHub, or as a trial in Anypoint Studio. 
# Use Case
<!-- Use Case (start) -->
This Anypoint template serves as a foundation for setting an online sync of accounts/customers from Salesforce to SAP.

Use this template if would like to sync accounts from Salesforce to SAP customers in manner of one time synchronization by browse toting the HTTP endpoint. The template will fetch all accounts by specified criteria and send it as IDoc to SAP to create/update customer there.
Requirements have been set not only to be used as examples, but also to establish a starting point to adapt your integration to your requirements.

As implemented, this template leverages the Mule batch module.
The batch job is divided into *Process* and *On Complete* stages.
The integration is triggered by the HTTP endpoint to fetch all the Salesforce Accounts suitable for migration.
Fetched accounts are passed to the batch as input. In the batch the customer is fetched from SAP by its name.
If it exists, its SAP Account Group is resolved against SAP. If it doesn't exist, then new customer number is fetched from SAP.
Afterwards every such account from Salesforce is sent to SAP in form of iDoc XML where it is asynchronously updated or created.
Finally during the *On Complete* stage the template logs output statistics data into the console and send a notification e-mail with the results of the batch execution.

<!-- Considerations (start) -->
To make this template run, there are certain preconditions that must be considered. All of them deal with the preparations in both, that must be made for the template to run smoothly.
**Failing to do so could lead to unexpected behavior of the template.**

Before using this template, you may want to check out this [Documentation Page](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/SAP+Connector#SAPConnector-EnablingYourStudioProjectforSAP), that will teach you how to work 
with SAP and Anypoint Studio.

## Disclaimer

This Anypoint template uses a few private Maven dependencies from Mulesoft in order to work. If you intend to run this template with Maven support, you need to add three extra dependencies for SAP to the pom.xml.
<!-- Considerations (end) -->


## SAP Considerations

Here's what you need to know to get this template to work with SAP.


### As a Data Destination

There is limitation on maximum length of Customer name in SAP. Therefore this template strips off all Account Name characters beyond 20.
## Salesforce Considerations

Here's what you need to know about Salesforce to get this template to work:

- Where can I check that the field configuration for my Salesforce instance is the right one? See: <a href="https://help.salesforce.com/HTViewHelpDoc?id=checking_field_accessibility_for_a_particular_field.htm&language=en_US">Salesforce: Checking Field Accessibility for a Particular Field</a>.
- Can I modify the Field Access Settings? How? See: <a href="https://help.salesforce.com/HTViewHelpDoc?id=modifying_field_access_settings.htm&language=en_US">Salesforce: Modifying Field Access Settings</a>.

### As a Data Source

If the user who configured the template for the source system does not have at least *read only* permissions for the fields that are fetched, then an *InvalidFieldFault* API fault displays.

```
java.lang.RuntimeException: [InvalidFieldFault [ApiQueryFault 
[ApiFault  exceptionCode='INVALID_FIELD'
exceptionMessage='Account.Phone, Account.Rating, Account.RecordTypeId, 
Account.ShippingCity
^
ERROR at Row:1:Column:486
No such column 'RecordTypeId' on entity 'Account'. If you are attempting to 
use a custom field, be sure to append the '__c' after the custom field name. 
Reference your WSDL or the describe call for the appropriate names.'
]
row='1'
column='486'
]
]
```

### Importing a Template into Studio
In Studio, click the Exchange X icon in the upper left of the taskbar, log in with your Anypoint Platform credentials, search for the template, and click Open.
<!-- Importing into Studio (start) -->

<!-- Importing into Studio (end) -->

### Running on Studio
After you import your template into Anypoint Studio, follow these steps to run it:

+ Locate the properties file `mule.dev.properties`, in src/main/resources.
+ Complete all the properties required as per the examples in the "Properties to Configure" section.
+ Right click the template project folder.
+ Hover your mouse over `Run as`.
+ Click `Mule Application (configure)`.
+ Inside the dialog, select Environment and set the variable `mule.env` to the value `dev`.
+ Click `Run`.
<!-- Running on Studio (start) -->
In order to make this template run on Anypoint Studio there are a few extra steps that needs to be made.
Please check this Documentation Page:

+ [Enabling Your Studio Project for SAP](https://docs.mulesoft.com/connectors/sap-connector#configuring-the-connector-in-studio-7)
<!-- Running on Studio (end) -->

### Running on Mule Standalone
Update the properties in one of the property files, for example in mule.prod.properties, and run your app with a corresponding environment variable. In this example, use `mule.env=prod`. 


## Running on CloudHub
When creating your application in CloudHub, go to Runtime Manager > Manage Application > Properties to set the environment variables listed in "Properties to Configure" as well as the mule.env value.
<!-- Running on Cloudhub (start) -->

# Customize It!
This brief guide provides a high level understanding of how this template is built and how you can change it according to your needs. As Mule applications are based on XML files, this page describes the XML files used with this template. More files are available such as test classes and Mule application files, but to keep it simple, we focus on these XML files:

* config.xml
* businessLogic.xml
* endpoints.xml
* errorHandling.xml<!-- Customize it (start) -->

<!-- Customize it (end) -->

## config.xml
<!-- Default Config XML (start) -->
This file provides the configuration for connectors and configuration properties. Only change this file to make core changes to the connector processing logic. Otherwise, all parameters that can be modified should instead be in a properties file, which is the recommended place to make changes.<!-- Default Config XML (end) -->

<!-- Config XML (start) -->

<!-- Config XML (end) -->

## businessLogic.xml
<!-- Default Business Logic XML (start) -->
Functional aspect of the template is implemented on this XML, directed by one flow responsible of excecuting the logic.
For the purpose of this particular template the *mainFlow* just executes the Batch Job which handles all the logic of it.
This flow has Error Handling that basically consists on invoking the *On Error Propagate Component* defined in *errorHandling.xml* file.<!-- Default Business Logic XML (end) -->

<!-- Business Logic XML (start) -->

<!-- Business Logic XML (end) -->

## endpoints.xml
<!-- Default Endpoints XML (start) -->
This file provides the inbound and outbound sides of your integration app.
This template has only an [HTTP Inbound Endpoint](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/HTTP+Endpoint+Reference) as the way to trigger the use case.
**HTTP Inbound Endpoint** - Start Synchronization
+ `${http.port}` is set as a property to be defined either on a property file or in CloudHub environment variables.
+ The path configured by default is `migrateaccounts` and you are free to change for the one you prefer.
+ The host name for all endpoints in your CloudHub configuration should be defined as `localhost`. CloudHub will then route requests from your application domain URL to the endpoint.
+ The endpoint is configured as a *request-response* since as a result of calling it the response will be the total of Accounts migrated and filtered by the criteria specified.<!-- Default Endpoints XML (end) -->

<!-- Endpoints XML (start) -->

## errorHandling.xml
<!-- Default Error Handling XML (start) -->
This file handles how your integration reacts depending on the different exceptions. This file provides error handling that is referenced by the main flow in the business logic.<!-- Default Error Handling XML (end) -->
