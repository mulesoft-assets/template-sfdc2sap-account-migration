			This Anypoint Template should serve as a foundation for setting an online sync of accounts/customers from Salesforce to SAP.
			Everytime there is a new account or a change in already existing one in Salesforce instance, the template will fetch it and send it as IDoc to SAP to update customer there.
			
			Requirements have been set not only to be used as examples, but also to establish a starting point to adapt your integration to your requirements.
			
			As implemented, this Anypoint Template leverage the [Batch Module](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Batch+Processing).
			The batch job is divided in Input, Process and On Complete stages.
			The integration is triggered by poll to Salesforce Accounts. New or modified accounts are passed to the batch as input.
			In the batch the customer is fetched from SAP by its name. If it exists, its SAP Account Group is resolved against SAP.
			If it doesn't exist, then new customer number is fetched from SAP. Afterwards every such account from Salesforce is sent to SAP in form of iDoc XML where it is asynchronously updated or created. 
			Finally during the On Complete stage the Anypoint Template will log output statistics data into the console.
